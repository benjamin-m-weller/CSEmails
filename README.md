# CSEmails
Personal side project. I noticed that I was getting an large number of emails from the career center about Computer Science Jobs/Internships. I didn't want to block the emails so I filtered them in to a different folder and batch sorted/reduced them with this program.

This project was completed in a weekend during my second semester in my Computer Science undergrad. I obviously didnâ€™t have the largest lens to view the landscape, but I produced a functional app for myself.
